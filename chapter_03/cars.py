### Organizing a List ###

""" Often, your lists will be created in an unpredictable order, because you can’t always control 
the order in which your users provide their data. Although this is unavoidable in most circumstances, 
you’ll frequently want to present your information in a particular order. Sometimes you’ll want to 
preserve the original order of your list, and other times you’ll want to change the original order. 
Python provides a number of different ways to organize your lists, depending on the situation. """


## Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method 

""" Python’s sort() method makes it relatively easy to sort a list. 
Imagine we have a list of cars and want to change the order of the list 
to store them alphabetically. To keep the task simple, let’s assume that 
all the values in the list are lowercase. """
