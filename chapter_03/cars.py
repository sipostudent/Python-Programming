### Organizing a List ###

""" Often, your lists will be created in an unpredictable order, because you can’t always control 
the order in which your users provide their data. Although this is unavoidable in most circumstances, 
you’ll frequently want to present your information in a particular order. Sometimes you’ll want to 
preserve the original order of your list, and other times you’ll want to change the original order. 
Python provides a number of different ways to organize your lists, depending on the situation. """
