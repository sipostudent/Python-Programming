""" Every variable is connected to a 
value, which is the information associated with that variable. In this case
the value is the "Hello Python world!" text.
Adding a variable makes a little more work for the Python interpreter.
When it processes the first line, it associates the variable message with the
"Hello Python world!" text. When it reaches the second line, it prints the
value associated with message to the screen """
